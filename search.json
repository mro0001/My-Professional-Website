      "contents": "\nCV and Bio\nCV\nDecember 1, 2022\nI am currently an Assistant Professor of Public Administration at the\nUniversity of Idaho where I research local government management, data\nscience, budgeting, and economic development. I graduated with my\nPh.D. from the University of North Texas in 2015. Unlike many of my\ncontemporaries, I did not go directly into academia. Instead, I worked\nat the North Central Texas Council of Governments as a Transportation\nPlanner then as the Grant Manager at the John Peter Smith Foundation.\nThis experience was invaluable in shaping my understanding of local\ngovernance and changing the way I approach research.\nMy research into local governments is eclectic–much like my\nprofessional history–and explores data science, budgeting and economic\ndevelopment. More specifically, I study competition among local\ngovernments, economic development and municipal fiscal health, and data\nscience in the public sector. My research has been published in Public\nAdministration Review, the American Review of Public Administration,\nState and Local Government Review, the International Journal of Public\nAdministration, Municipal Finance Journal, and Teaching Public\nAdministration.\nWhile I teach a variety of courses, I primarily teach courses in\nLocal Government Management and Public Budgeting and Finance. I enjoy\nfinding unique ways to introduce students to public administration. For\nexample, I developed and taught an introductory PA course for\nundergraduates that required no textbook and instead assigned episodes\nof Parks and Recreation. My strongest pedagogical contribution has been\nin the area of data science where I have taught multiple courses for MPA\nstudents and even designed a graduate level data science certificate for\nthose without math or programming backgrounds.\nMy career has been a wild ride and while I still feel uncomfortable\nabout promoting this information because it feels like bragging, I have\nreceived the following awards and honors:\n2021 Benjamin and Patricia Doty Award, University of Idaho\n2017 ASPA Founders Fellow, American Society of Public\nAdministration\n2016 Leadership Acceleration Program, John Peter Smith Health\nNetwork\n2016 Lincoln Scholars Program, Lincoln Institute of Land Policy\n2015 Toulouse Dissertation Award in Social Science, University of\nNorth Texas\nI am proud to serve the public sector in my roll as a professor. It\nis a gift to have the flexibility to research, teach, and collaborate\nwith local governments to serve the public.\nIf you care to read more about me, you can find a more in-depth\nprofile here\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nGrants\nAs a tenure track professor, I have generated over $600,000 in\nexternal grants from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban\nDevelopment, Smart Transit, the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, and\nthe North Central Texas Council of Governments. Before beginning my\nacademic career, I was a grant manager for the John Peter Smith\nFoundation–the non-profit arm of the Tarrant County, TX hospital network\nwhere I learned how to write and manage local, state, federal, and\nnon-profit grants that had nothing to do with research. I have some\nstrong opinions about grant writing as an academic and as a\nprofessional in the public sector. Hopefully, my experience can help\nothers on their grant journey.\nConsulting\nMy grant writing experience and success can be useful for non-profits\nand governments looking for help developing and reviewing proposals, but\nmore importantly, creating a grant strategy that leverages an\norganizations strengths while being mindful of the funding environment.\nFeel free to reach out to me if you have any questions about my grant\nconsulting services\n\n\n\n",
